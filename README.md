Here you can see a nice little application with updating to-do list. Not finished yet, though. 

I'm still suffering because of css, so i'm asking you again - don't judge the design strictly, I'm trying.

02/12/22 - i'm watching tutorials for react on youtube and doing things with it. Maybe i'll get to to_do list and it will be my first functional app.

03/12/22 - i'm trying to figure out how to handle user actions. Connected Material UI. Well, at least i don't need to wright myself all the buttons, checkboxes and other things. I'm starting to suspect that I have no time to do something with my main App. But I'm starting to like react itself. Maybe I'll continue studying it just for fun.

04/12/22 - i'm working on to-do list. i made it work with separate file with data for the list. but it needs to take new data from the user, not from the file. so, still work in progress. 

07/12/2022 - No progress for past 2 days, 'cause i was busy with other studying things. And now i'm writing a report for this project. 
I deleted mainApp folder with this stupid project. It was my old unfinished project and i made in actually functional, so i have something to submit here. But now i'm fully working on React App and i have something to show. 

Hoping you won't change your mind about rating! I was shocked, thank you very much, you made me happy.
