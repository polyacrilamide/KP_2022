It is website for sharing information about meds (mainApp folder).

I have no idea how to make a good looking html page with all that css, which breaking down after every edit. 

I tried hard to do something good, but i don't really wanna go deeply into it so i'm not having enough motivation to spent a lot of time learning and trying. I have ideas, but i can't realize it and it making me very-very sad and demotivated.

And all that react js  stuff... I'll try to do something with it before sunday. If i succeed - everything will be in the repository. And i'll change this little message of pain.

02/12/22 - i'm watching tutorials for react on youtube and doing things with it. Maybe i'll get to to_do list and it will be my first functional app.

03/12/22 - i'm trying to figure out how to handle user actions. Connected Material UI. Well, at least i don't need to wright myself all the buttons, checkboxes and other things. I'm starting to suspect that I have no time to do something with my main App. But I'm starting to like react itself. Maybe I'll continue studying it just for fun.


I hope this will be enough to get a positive rating. I'll be so happy, if you rate me with 4, really.
